This api wrapper allows you to access [Danbooru's API](https://danbooru.donmai.us/wiki_pages?title=help%3Aapi) with functions and promises.

It works in Node.js and bundled for browsers where fetch is available.

```js
const Danbooru = require('danbooru')

// Perform a search for popular image posts
const booru = new Danbooru()
booru.posts({ tags: 'rating:safe order:rank' }).then(posts => {
  // Select a random post from posts array
  const index = Math.floor(Math.random() * posts.length)
  const post = posts[index]

  // Get post's url and create a filename for it
  const url = booru.url(post.file_url)
  const name = `${post.md5}.${post.file_ext}`

  // Download post image using node's https and fs libraries
  require('https').get(url, response => {
    response.pipe(require('fs').createWriteStream(name))
  })
})
```

## Using this module

Once I've fleshed out this module a bit more, I plan to create more complete documentation for it. For now, here are some things you can do.

### Danbooru class

This module exports a `Danbooru` class. Calling its constructor with no argument allows you to make unauthenticated requests to https://danbooru.donmai.us/.

```js
const booru = new Danbooru()
```

If you would like to make authenticated requests, you can pass an authentication string in the format `login:api_key`.

```js
const login = 'login'
const key = 'api_key'
const booru = new Danbooru(login + ':' + key)
```

If you have an alternate Danbooru address you would like to connect to, you also specify that in this string.

```js
const booru = new Danbooru('http://safebooru.donmai.us/')

const login = 'login'
const key = 'api_key'

const authenticatedBooru = new Danbooru(
  `https://${login}:${key}@sonohara.donmai.us`
)
```

### Getting an array of posts

Posts represent images on Danbooru. You can query them like this:

```js
const posts = await booru.posts({ limit: 100 })
```

Your parameters are passed directly to Danbooru's API:

* `limit` - The number of posts you'd like to retrieve on one page.
* `page` - The page number you'd like to retrieve. Bigger numbers have older posts.
* `tags` - Your Danbooru [search tags](https://danbooru.donmai.us/wiki_pages?title=help%3Acheatsheet). You can use two tags unauthenticated, as well as `rating:safe` as a third tag for free.
* `md5` - An image md5 to search for.
* `random` - A boolean that randomizes your results.
* `raw` - Disables tag parsing, treating `tags` as a single literal tag.

You'll get an array of objects that looks like this:
https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts.json

### Getting a single post by its id

You can also look up a single post using the same function:

```js
const post = await booru.posts(2560676)
```

You'll get an object: https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/2560676.json

### Getting an image

Once you have a post, you'll likely want to extract its image. The most useful object properties for this purpose are:

* `file_url`: The post image. For small images, this is the same as `large_file_url`.
* `large_file_url`: The image you see by default on Danbooru, which may be scaled down.
* `preview_file_url`: The tiny thumbnail used to represent this image.

You can pass one of these values to `booru.url()` to generate a `URL` object, which you can turn into an absolute url by accessing `url.href` or just typecasting it.

```js
const post = await booru.posts(2560676)
const url = booru.url(post.file_url)

// Node.js
const request = http.get(url.href)

// Browsers
const response = await fetch(url)
```

### Manipulating favorites

Previous versions of this library have had functions to manipulate favorites for an authenticated user, so you can still do that with this version.

```js
// Add a favorite
booru.favorites_create(2560676)

// Remove a favorite
booru.favorites_destroy(2560676)
```

Please note that due to Danbooru's security settings, this function may fail in browsers.

### Other endpoints

If you would like to do something I haven't added to this module yet, you can use these methods:

```js
booru.get('/posts', queryStringParams)
booru.post('/favorites', bodyParams)
booru.put('/posts/2560676', bodyParams)
booru.delete('/favorites/2560676', bodyParams)
```

They all take two arguments. The first is a path, and the second is your parameters. They'll be sent as JSON for `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests, and as part of a query string for `GET` requests.

Your paths' leading slashes are optional, but don't add extensions or query strings. These functions will automatically add `.json` and any specified query string properties to the end.

Due to Danbooru's security settings, custom `GET` requests should work in browsers, but other methods may fail.

## Upgrading from previous versions

This module was completely rewritten for each major release before this one.

Version 1 used callbacks, so upgrading involves completely rewriting your code.

Version 2 used promises like the current version does, so it should be possible to upgrade your code by swapping out some function calls, though you will need to rewrite code involving the old `Post` type.

### Instantiation

This module's class constructor now always takes a string.

The Safebooru subclass has been removed. You can still specify `https://safebooru.donmai.us` manually.

```js
// Version 2
const booru = new Danbooru('login', 'api_key')

// Version 3
const booru = new Danbooru('login:api_key')
```

```js
// Version 2
const booru = new Danbooru({
  login: 'login',
  api_key: 'api_key',
  base: 'https://safebooru.donmai.us'
})

// Version 2 and 3
const booru = new Danbooru('https://login:api_key@safebooru.donmai.us')
```

### Searching for posts

Searching for posts now always takes a parameter object.

```js
// Version 2
const posts = await booru.posts('rating:safe')

// Version 2 and 3
const posts = await booru.posts({ tags: 'rating:safe' })
```

### Fetching posts

Getting individual posts is now performed via the main `.posts()` function

```js
// Version 2
const post = await booru.posts.get(2560676)

// Version 3
const post = await booru.posts(2560676)
```

### Posts object

There is no longer a posts object. These functions all return normal JavaScript objects that you can interact with normally.

Please refer to [Getting an image](#getting-an-image) above for details on how to download images. Many of the properties on the old `.file` object can still be accessed as part of the post data object.

```js
// Version 2
post.raw

// Version 3
post
```

```js
// Version 2
post.tags

// Version 3
post.tag_string.split(' ')
```

```js
// Version 2
String(post.rating)

// Version 3
post.rating
```

### Favorites

Functions that work with favorites have been renamed.

```js
// Version 2 or 3
const favorites = await booru.favorites()
```

```js
// Version 2
booru.favorites.add(2560676)
booru.favorites.add(post)

// Version 3
booru.favorites_create(2560676)
booru.favorites_create(post.id)
```

```js
// Version 2
booru.favorites.delete(2560676)
booru.favorites.delete(post)

// Version 3
booru.favorites_destroy(2560676)
booru.favorites_destroy(post.id)
```

### Using previous versions

If you prefer older versions of this module, you can still install them with one of these commands, and find documentation for them on GitHub.
